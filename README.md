# BreastCancerNN
Very bad! Do not reference. It's 3:30 am and i regret everything. Suffers from very inconsistent accuracies and this dataset only having 500 datapoints does not help. Based off of http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ and absolutely disfigured the code i'm so sorry. At least i learnt a thing or two...

Added Feature: OVERFITTING
Gets a lot worse as it trains. Sometimes gets 50ish acc if you're lucky, other times it's 8 take it or leave it.
Maybe fidgeting with hyper-parameters would help but it's too late and i'm going to sleep.
